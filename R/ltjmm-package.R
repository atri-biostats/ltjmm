#' Latent Time Joint Mixed Effect Models ('ltjmm')
#' 
#' @description Diseases that progress over long periods of time are often studied
#'   by observing cohorts at different stages of disease for shorter periods of
#'   time. We apply MCMC sampling to estimate Latent Time Joint Mixed Effect Models
#'   (LTJMM) from short-term observations with unknown relative observation times.
