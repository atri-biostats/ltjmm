Description: Diseases that progress over long periods of time are often studied
    by observing cohorts at different stages of disease for shorter periods of
    time. We apply MCMC sampling to estimate Latent Time Joint Mixed Effect Models
    (LTJMM) from short-term observations with unknown relative observation times.
